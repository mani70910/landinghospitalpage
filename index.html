                    Truly patient-centred care needs to 
                    be aligned with what patients consider 
                    important, and is highly desirable in 
                    the first 24â€‰h of an acute admission, as
                     many decisions are made during this period. 
                     However, there is limited knowledge on what
                      matters most to patients in this phase of 
                      their hospital stay. The objective of this 
                      study was to identify what mattered most to 
                      patients in acute care and to assess the patient 
                      perspective as to whether their 
                    treating doctors were aware of this.

                We have generally associated hospital
                 with illness but the case is the 
                 opposite of wellness. In other 
                 words, we visit the hospital all 
                 sick and leave healthy or better 
                 than before. Moreover, hospitals
                  play an 
                essential role in offering 
                consultation services to patients 
                and making the population healthier.

                Hospitals are institutions that deal 
                with health care activities. They offer
                 treatment to patients with specialized 
                 staff and equipment. In other words, 
                 hospitals serve humanity and play a
                  vital role in the social welfare of 
                  any society. They have all the
                   facilities to deal with varying diseases to
                 make the patient healthy. The essay on hospital will 
                 take us through their types and importance.

                A visit to a hospital is a whole lot of experience in itself. 
                During the last summer, one of my friends met with
                 an accident and was admitted to hospital. When 
                 I went to see him, I went to the hospital
                 for the very first time
                  in my life. As I entered the hospital, 
                  I saw people coming and going there.
